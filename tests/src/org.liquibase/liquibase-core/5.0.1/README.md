The metadata has been generated by executing the following script:

```bash
./generate-metadata.sh
```

The generated metadata can be found in the `build/native/agent-output/test` directory.

Afterwards, the generated metadata has been cleaned:
- Remove path to test resources
- Remove `META-INF/services` entries
- Remove H2 references

Additionally, you have to add the entries from `additional-entries.json` to `reflect-config.json`.
No idea why the agent doesn't detect them.

And

```json
{
  "name": "setOnSqlOutput",
  "parameterTypes": [
    "java.lang.String"
  ]
},
{
  "name": "setOnFail",
  "parameterTypes": [
    "java.lang.String"
  ]
},
{
  "name": "setOnError",
  "parameterTypes": [
    "liquibase.precondition.core.PreconditionContainer$ErrorOption"
  ]
},
```

has to be added to the methods of `liquibase.precondition.core.PreconditionContainer`.
