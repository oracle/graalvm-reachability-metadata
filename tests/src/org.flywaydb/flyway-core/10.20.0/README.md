The metadata has been generated by executing the following script:

```bash
./generate-metadata.sh
```

The generated metadata can be found in the `build/native/agent-output/test` directory.

Afterwards, the generated metadata has been cleaned:
- Remove path to test resources
- Remove `META-INF/services` entries
- Remove H2 references
